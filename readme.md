# Mesh generation using Kohonen self-organizing maps

![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png "Sample inline image")

A mesh generator using machine learning. In particular the software uses the Kohonen self organizing map
based on the work of:

Kohonen, T. (2012). 
Self-organizing  maps.
