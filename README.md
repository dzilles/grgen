# Mesh generation using Kohonen self-organizing maps

A mesh generator using machine learning. In particular the software uses the Kohonen self organizing map
based on the work of T. Kohonen [[1]](#1) and O. Nechaeva [[2]](#2) where some input structured or unstructured mesh is trained to represent the input geometry. The following animation shows the learning process:
